# Algo: A Backend Development Learning Path

This repository documents my journey through backend development, focusing on fundamental concepts of computer science. It serves as a personal knowledge base and a portfolio of projects and exercises.

## Core Concepts Covered

This repository is organized around several key areas of backend development:

*   **System Programming:** Exploring low-level programming concepts, memory management, and process control.
*   **Algorithms:** Implementing and studying various algorithms, with a focus on sorting, searching, and problem-solving strategies.
*   **Data Structures:** Building and using fundamental data structures like linked lists, trees, and hash tables.
*   **Graphics:** Implementing basic graphics algorithms, like line drawing and raster scanning.
*   **Custom Libraries:** Development of a personal C library (`mylibc`) with common functionalities for use in different projects.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into several sub-repositories, each with a specific focus:

### `C2_push_swap`

This is a project from the 42 school curriculum. The goal is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. This project challenges understanding of sorting algorithms and stack manipulation.

### `S2_LeetC`

This directory contains solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented in C. The problems are categorized into:

*   **Problem Solving:** Greedy algorithms, backtracking, and concurrent programming.
*   **Data Structures:** Implementations of various data structures.
*   **Graphics:** Basic graphics algorithms.
*   **System & Network:** System programming and networking exercises.
